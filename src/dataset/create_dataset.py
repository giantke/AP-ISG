"""
Script creates train.csv, valid.csv, test.csv and test-2.csv to train object detector (as a standalone module),
object detector + binary classifiers, and full model.

Each row in the csv files specifies information about a single image.

The specific information (i.e. columns) of each row are:
    - subject_id (str): id of the patient whose image is used
    - study_id (str): id of the study of that patient (since a patient can have several studies done to document the progression of a disease etc.)
    - image_id (str): id of the single image
    - mimic_image_file_path (str): file path to the jpg of the single image on the workstation
    - bbox_coordinates (List[List[int]]): a nested list where the outer list (usually) has a length of 29 and the inner list always a length of 4 (for 4 bbox coordinates).
    Contains the bbox coordinates for all (usually 29) regions of a single image. There are some images that don't have bbox coordinates for all 29 regions
    (see log_file_dataset_creation.txt), thus it's possible that the outer list does not have length 29.
    - bbox_labels (List[int]): a list of (usually) length 29 that has region/class labels corresponding to the bbox_coordinates. Usually, the bbox_labels list will be
    of the form [1, 2, 3, ..., 28, 29], i.e. continuously counting from 1 to 29. It starts at 1 since 0 is considered the background class for object detectors.
    However, since some images don't have bbox coordinates for all 29 regions, it's possible that there are missing numbers in the list.
    - bbox_phrases (List[str]): a list of (always) length 29 that has the reference phrases for every bbox of a single image. Note that a lot of these reference phrases
    will be "" (i.e. empty), since a radiology report describing an image will usually not contain phrases for all 29 regions.
    - bbox_phrase_exists (List[bool]): a list of (always) length 29 that indicates if a bbox has a reference phrase (True) or not
    - bbox_is_abnormal (List[bool]): a list of (always) length 29 that indicates if a bbox was described as abnormal (True) by its reference phrase or not. bboxes that do
    not have a reference phrase are considered normal by default.

The valid.csv, test.csv and test-2.csv have the additional information of:
    - reference_report (str): the "findings" section of the MIMIC-CXR report corresponding to the image (see function get_reference_report)

For the validation set, we only include images that have bbox_coordinates, bbox_labels for all 29 regions.
This is done because:
    1. We will usually not evaluate on the whole validation set (which contains 23,953 images), but only on a fraction of it (e.g. 5% - 20%).
    2. Writing code that evaluates on all 29 regions is easier and more performant (-> e.g. vectorization possible). If there are some images with < 29 regions,
    then the code has to accomodate them, making vectorization more difficult.

For the test set, we split it into 1 test set that only contains images with bbox_coordinates, bbox_labels for all 29 regions (which are around 95% of all test set images),
and 1 test set (called test-2.csv) that contains the remaining images that do not have bbox_coordinates, bbox_labels for all 29 regions (the remaining 5% of test set images).

This is done such that we can apply vectorized, efficient code to evaluate the 1st test set (which contains 95% of all test set images),
and more inefficient code to evaluate the 2nd test set (which only contains 5% of test set images), and of course the results of 1st and 2nd test set are reported together.

The train set contains all train images, even those without bbox_coordinates, bbox_labels for all 29 regions (because we don't need to evaluate on the train set).
